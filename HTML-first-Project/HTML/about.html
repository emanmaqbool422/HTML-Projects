          <p>
            Allama Muhammad Iqbal (1877–1938) was a renowned poet, philosopher,
            and visionary leader from Sialkot. Through his powerful poetry and
            thought-provoking ideas, he inspired Muslims to seek self-respect,
            unity, and freedom. His dream of a separate homeland became the
            foundation of Pakistan’s creation.
